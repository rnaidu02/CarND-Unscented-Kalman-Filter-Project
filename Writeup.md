**Unscented Kalman Filter Project**

The goals / steps of this project are the following:
* Initialize Unscented Kalman filter variables and in particular modify the process noise variables (`std_a_`, `std_yawdd_`) and  Covariance vector
 (`P_`) for the sensor.
* Implement Prediction function that predicts mean values of data points (`x_`) and state co-variance matrix (`P_`)
* Implement
* Test that the model successfully drives around track one without leaving the road
* Summarize the results with a written report
